### Code Quality Rules
- Code must be thought fot not to break in a few years of usage
- Production-ready code only (no TODO, FIXME, or commented-out code)
- Follow DDD, SOLID, Clean Architecture
- Long-term focus: write code that won't break in 1-2 years
- Descriptive naming (e.g. `response` vs `r`)
- English for code, comments, and vars
- When try/catch, catch should always throw the specific error, never be empty
- Don't create readme files unless absolutely necessary and only when the module is fully implemented
